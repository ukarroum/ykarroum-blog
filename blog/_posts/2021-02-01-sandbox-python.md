title: 'Sandboxing untrusted Python code using Chroot Jail'
---

In this article, I'll show you how we can run untrusted python code safely. We'll visit different python sanitization heuristics and show their limitations and why building a chroot jail is probably the safest way to do it.

I assume that the reader have some basic knowledge of Linux, but I'll do my best to explain everyused concept.
