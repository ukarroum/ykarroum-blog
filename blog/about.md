My name is Yassir Karroum, I am a quantitative developer at *Millennium*, in _Paris_.

My day to day job involves coding in Python and C++.

In this blog, I'll post articles on various subjects.

I also play a fair amount of league of legends (proudly hardstuck at silver/gold), you can catch me on euw : [black2N](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=black2N).
